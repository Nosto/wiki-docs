# Nosto Account Setup

The plugin creates a new menu item during installation, that is located under the Settings menu in the backend. Note that you may have to clear the cache and reload the backend for the menu item to show up.

By clicking the menu item, a window will open showing the Nosto account configuration per shop that is installed. You will need one Nosto account for each shop.

Creating the account is as easy as clicking the install button on the page. Note the email field above it. You will need to enter your own email to be able to activate your account. After clicking install, the window will refresh and show the account configuration.

You can also connect and existing Nosto account to a shop, by using the link below the install button. This will take you to Nosto where you choose the account to connect, and you will then be redirected back where you will see the same configuration screen as when having created a new account.

You should now be able to view the default recommendations in your shops frontend by clicking the preview button on the page.

#### Custom Fields
This option enables sending product attributes as custom fields to Nosto. The information is present on the tagging and in the page source, but hidden. If this option is disabled, the information is removed from the page source code.

#### SKU-Tagging

###### What are SKU's?

For example, you might sell a shoe with different sizes. The size option might have many options ranging from 37 to 42. The SKUs will be different single products with the desired size. Another common term for an SKU in this context is variation. To avoid confusion with Nosto price variations we use the term SKU in this document. 

Once SKUs are enabled, you will be able to preview by navigating to any product page and appending `nostodebug=true` to the URLs query string.

###### Which fields are used?

* **Availability**: The availability of each SKU is tracked individually while the availability of the whole products is defined by the cumulative availability of all SKUs. If all SKUs are out of stock, only then will the parent product be considered out of stock.

* **Prices**: Prices are tagged on the SKU level. If the SKU doesn't have a customised price, the price and list price are that of the parent product.

* **Name**: The name of the SKU is the normally auto generated by Shopware and is what is used by Nosto. If the name is customised, then the customised name is automatically used.

* **Item Code**: The identifier of the SKU is the internal Shopware ID of the product.

###### Enabling / Disabling SKUs

SKU's (since `2.1.0`) are enabled by default. You can toggle off the SKU's by navigating to the Configuration -> Basic Settings -> Additional Settings and toggling **Enable SKU Tagging** under the desired shop front.

###### Performance

Enabling SKU tagging will impact performance as more queries are executed against the database to load all SKU data.

It is recommended that you use a production-grade full-page caching mechanism (FPC.).
