## Products limit per page

The module has a limit of 250 products per page. 
This is related to the limit set for our internal cmp query. 

In case you have enabled the `Show all products` feature on our catalog page, 
you can increase the limit to what fits your best needs. 
In order to increase it navigate to `Stores > Settings > Configuration > Services > Nosto Category Merchandising` 
and change the value for `Max product limit`

#### Warning
Increasing the limit can affect the catalog page load time. The module will make multiple calls
to iterate through the number of pages that match the new maximum limit of products.
