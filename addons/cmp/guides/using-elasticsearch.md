# Using Elasticsearch

Previous to `v2.4.0`, Magento2 offers the possibility to select the catalog search engine between MySql and Elasticsearch. The following versions will use Elasticsearch by default.

If you are using Elasticsearch as a search engine you must install Nosto CMP module version `>= 3.0.0` . The module does not require any further configuration.
