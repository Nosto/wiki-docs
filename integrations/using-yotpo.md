# Using Yotpo

Nosto for Magento supports ratings and reviews powered by Yotpo. In order to begin leveraging Yotpo ratings and reviews in Nosto, you'll need to install [Yotpo's extension for Magento](https://github.com/YotpoLtd/magento-plugin).

## Configuring Yotpo for Magento

Once you've installed the Yotpo for Magento extension, you'll need to follow their guide on [setting up "rich snippets" in Magento](https://support.yotpo.com/en/article/magento-installing-yotpo).

## Configuring Nosto to use Yotpo

You can switch the rating and reviews metadata provider to be Yotpo by navigating to the configuration page and toggling **Ratings source** to **Use Yotpo** under the **Ratings & Reviews** section.

**Note:** the **Use Yotpo** option is only visible once Yotpo's extension for Magento is installed.
