# Using Judge.Me

Nosto for Shopify supports ratings and reviews powered by JudgeMe. In order to begin leveraging JudgeMe's ratings and reviews in Nosto, you'll need to install [Judge.Me's app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme?).

## Configuring Nosto to use JudgeMe

Once you have installed and configured JudgeMe on your Shopify store, you'll need to contact our support personnel who can enable the integration for you. This is a one-time operation after which Nosto begins collecting the rating and review metadata automatically. There is no additional configuration required on Nosto's end.
