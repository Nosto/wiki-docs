# Using Yotpo

Nosto for Shopify supports ratings and reviews powered by Yotpo. In order to begin leveraging Yotpo ratings and reviews in Nosto, you'll need to install [Yotpo's app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/yotpo-social-reviews).

In order for Nosto to be able to read product reviews, the Google Rich Snippets feature needs to be enabled in Yotpo. For details on how to enable this, please reach out to Yotpo support.

## Configuring Nosto to use Yotpo

Once you have installed and configured Yotpo on your Shopify store, please reach out to Nosto support to ensure that we can begin collecting the rating and review metadata.
