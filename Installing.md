# Installing

### Step 1: Install the Nosto App

1. **Log into** your Shopify Admin Panel.
2. **Find the** [**Nosto app**](https://apps.shopify.com/nosto-personalization-for-shopify) on the Shopify App Store.&#x20;
3. **Install the app**. Click 'Add app' and follow the installation instructions.

### Step 2: Connect Your Shopify Store to Nosto

1. **Launch the Nosto app** from your Shopify dashboard.
2. **Authorize the connection** between your Shopify store and Nosto by following the on-screen instructions.

### Step 3: Activate Nosto for your Themes

1. **In Shopify admin navigate to your Theme settings.** Go to 'Online Store' -> 'Themes' -> 'Customize'.
2. **Find the Nosto module under 'App embeds'**
   * Ensure that **Nosto Script** is enabled.
   * Depending on your needs, enable [**Multi-Currency**](https://docs.nosto.com/shopify/features/multi-currency-support) Tagging as well.&#x20;

### Step 4: Add Nosto-Placements to your Theme

1. **Find the Nosto module under 'App Blocks'**
2. **Add Placement ID** as value in your Nosto Block. This only applies to "static placements". More info on Placements can be found [here](https://help.nosto.com/en/articles/1883767-placements-general-article).&#x20;
   * Nosto will recommend you the default set placements, but you can add every placementID you want, as long as there is a corresponding placement in Nosto.&#x20;
3. As with every Block in Shopify, you now can move around your placement freely, allowing you to position Nosto exactly where you want.&#x20;
