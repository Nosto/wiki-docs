The preferred way of installing the module is through PrestaShop Addons. It can, however, also be installed as a local module or directly from this GitHub repository if needed.

For development purposes, it is recommended to use the repository approach, as you can then easily keep track of any changes while having the module installed in PrestaShop.

## Installing via PrestaShop Add-ons

You will need to fetch the module zip archive from the [add-ons page](http://addons.prestashop.com/en/advertising-marketing-newsletter-modules/18349-nostotagging.html) and upload it to the backend of your PrestaShop installation.

To install the module in PrestaShop, navigate to the `Modules` section in the backend and locate the module under the `Advertising & Marketing` section. Then just click the `Install` button next to the module in the list. That's it!

## Installing via a direct download (ZIP)

The module can also be installed as a local package by uploading the zip archive manually in the PrestaShop backend, or by unpacking it into the PrestaShop `modules` folder inside your installation. Note that the folder name of the module must be `nostotagging`.

Now the module should be visible in the PrestaShop backend on the `Modules` page. Follow the instructions in section PrestaShop Add-ons, to install the module.

The module zip archive can be obtained from the [add-ons page](http://addons.prestashop.com/en/advertising-marketing-newsletter-modules/18349-nostotagging.html) or the projects [releases](https://github.com/Nosto/nostotagging/releases) page on GitHub.

## Installing via a repository (Github)

For development purposes, the module can be installed directly from this GitHub repository by cloning the project to your PrestaShop `modules` folder inside your installation. For the module to work, it's dependencies also need to be installed. These are included as git submodules in the repository, and can be cloned together with the module by using the `--recursive` flag, e.g. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Nosto/nostotagging.git`.

Now the module should be visible in the PrestaShop backend on the `Modules` page. Follow the instructions in section PrestaShop Add-ons, to install the module.
