# Customizing Product Metadata

Unlike on our other platform integrations such as Magento, you cannot edit or customise any of the product metadata that is sent to Nosto.

Nosto relies on the webhooks \(API\) calls sent by Shopify to track changes to your product catalog and does not rely on the embedded tagging on the page.

Editing the core Nosto `snippets/nosto-tagging.liquid` file will simply result in incorrect recommendations with mangled pricing and availability information

> **Note:** In the event that you need guidance with customisations, please contact our support personnel. Our in-house Shopify Experts will be able to instruct and assist with the best course of action to ensure a smooth implementation.
