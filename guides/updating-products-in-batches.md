# Bulk Product Updates via Cron

In order to update products in batches to Nosto you have to create a separate small extension for PrestaShop. We have created an example implementation that you can use as a base for your custom product updater. You can find the example here: [https://github.com/Nosto/nosto-prestashop-cron](https://github.com/Nosto/nosto-prestashop-cron)
