â†’ Learn more about [How Nosto modifies your theme](how-nosto-modifies-your-theme.md)

1. Navigate to the Nosto settings and apply Nosto to your theme.
2. Use the preview links to ensure that everything is working as expected.
3. Download the theme to your local directory where your theme sources are version controlled
4. Use the Git tool to inspect all the changes made to your theme and commit them to the version control

If you have multiple themes, the same procedure can be used. We recommend that you read up on [Working with multiple themes](https://github.com/supercid/wiki-docs/tree/bdc4903353d378efd63bc3f5b6ee6f23990847c2/working-with-multiple-themes.md)
