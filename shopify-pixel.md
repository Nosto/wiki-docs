# Shopify Pixel

## Nosto directly integrates with Shopify Pixel <a href="#h_78f9ea695e" id="h_78f9ea695e"></a>

### How it works <a href="#h_145101014e" id="h_145101014e"></a>

By using the latest version of Nosto's Shopify app, you will automatically utilize the Pixel integration, allowing Nosto to correctly retrieve and attribute orders placed in the store.

To achieve this, Nosto places a Custom Pixel on your Thank You Page, fetching data about the items bought and sending it back to Nosto where the data will be tied to your customers journey on the page and used to attribute the sale accordingly, feeding into your Analytics.

This Pixel Integration replaces the previously used Script on your Thank You Page automatically - no further action needed.

### How to get started <a href="#h_7b4795e59f" id="h_7b4795e59f"></a>

#### For existing Nosto users <a href="#h_98b77b744b" id="h_98b77b744b"></a>

Nosto will require permission to access necessary data utilising the new Pixel.\
The permission request appears as follows and will be prompted when, in the Shopify admin UI, you navigate to: Settings > Apps and sales channels > Nosto:

Permission must be granted by your Shopify store admin.

Once permission is granted, the Nosto app will update automatically, setting the Pixel in your store. Please note that the process of activating the Pixel in Nosto and starting retrieving data can take a couple of hours. You will be able to see order data coming through within 24 hours after accepting permission.

#### For new Nosto users <a href="#h_f23d91a676" id="h_f23d91a676"></a>

Upon installing the Nosto app, the permission request is made automatically, as Nosto cannot be installed without it. There are no additional steps needed to start utilizing the Pixel, and you can proceed with the general onboarding process.

#### Connecting the Pixel <a href="#h_ecf36d4bd8" id="h_ecf36d4bd8"></a>

If you want to be sure everything is working correctly, you can come back after 24 hours, and check if the Pixel was connected correctly within you Shopify admin UI. To do so, navigate to Settings --> Customer Events. Here you should now see the Nosto Pixel listed, marked in green as "connected".

### Anything else to know? <a href="#h_c03a0adcc6" id="h_c03a0adcc6"></a>

If you're using Shopify International (former Shopify Markets), it's important to note that you will need to also use Shopify's new Thank You page, in order to allow accurate attribution to your orders to your matching Nosto instances.&#x20;

### What's next? <a href="#h_c03a0adcc6" id="h_c03a0adcc6"></a>

As next step, Nosto is currently working on new Extensions to also utilize Recommendations on Shopify's new Checkout, Thank You pages and Post Purchase pages. This update will be live within 2024.
