# Implement Search using Code Editor

To get started with Search on your website, navigate to the Search tab under 'On-site' within the Nosto UI. This is where everything for Search can be configured and controlled, including designing the templates for search pages and autocomplete dropdowns, as well as search analytics, query rules and other settings. Synonyms for search queries can also be configured here.

To begin implementing Search, navigate to the Templates tab under Search, and Click on “Open Code Editor”.

You will then be redirected to the VSCode Editor window. On the left-hand side is the project structure panel, and on the right-hand side is the very familiar code-editor panel. Note the components defined for both the Search Page and Autocomplete. These components can be used to define and extend behaviour on your website.

## **Why use the VSCode Editor?**

Code editor allows you to add a search function to your website quickly and easily without the need to use an API. You can customize the design of your search pages and autocomplete boxes to match your brand's look and feel. This saves you a lot of time compared to implementing search functionality through an API.
