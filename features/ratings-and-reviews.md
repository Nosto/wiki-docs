# Ratings & Reviews

Nosto supports tagging the rating and review metadata. The rating value and review count metadata can be used for creating advanced recommendation rules to promote products that are well reviewed.

The rating values can also be used to show star-ratings in your recommendation and email templates.

## Enabling / Disabling Rating-Value & Review-Count Metadata

The rating and review metadata collection is always on and does not have a corresponding toggle.

## Verifying

Once you've enabled the rating and reviews metadata, you should be able to see the new product metadata collected by Nosto.
