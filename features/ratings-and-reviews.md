# Ratings & Reviews

Nosto supports tagging the rating and review metadata. The rating value and review count metadata can be used for creating advanced recommendation rules to promote products that are well reviewed.

The rating values can also be used to show star-ratings in your recommendation and email templates.

## Enabling / Disabling Rating-Value & Review-Count Metadata

The ratings and reviews metadata collection are **enabled by default**. You can toggle the ratings and reviews metadata collection by navigating to the configuration page and toggling **Enable Ratings & Reviews** under the **Feature Flags** section.
