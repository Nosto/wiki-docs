# Search and Category Merchandising

Starting with version 3.0.0 of the Nosto Shopware 6 plugin, you can integrate Nosto **Personalized Search** and **Category Merchandising** without any additional API integration or Front End work required.

\
Once enabled, the plugin will automatically send a request to our Search API, and render results based on rules set in Nosto within your theme.&#x20;
