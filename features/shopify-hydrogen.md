description: Using Nosto's React Component Library built specifically for Shopify Hydrogen
---

# Shopify Hydrogen

[Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev) is a powerful React-based framework designed to create custom storefronts on Shopify. We have created a React component library as well as a demo storefront showcasing our solution for implementing Nosto in Hydrogen environments.

### Shopify Hydrogen React Component Library

Our [component library](https://github.com/Nosto/shopify-hydrogen), specifically tailored to Shopify Hydrogen, utilizes [nosto-react](https://github.com/Nosto/nosto-react) under the hood, while adding Hydrogen-specific hooks and logic to simplify Nosto integration.

Developers can easily install our library components via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nosto/shopify-hydrogen) into their Hydrogen-based projects to access Nosto's extensive feature set, including recommendations, onsite content personalization, dynamic bundles, pop-ups, and more. Please see below for more details.

### Demo Store

Our [live demo store](https://shopify-hydrogen-demo.nosto.com/) is deployed via Oxygen to showcase our integration in action. You can also view the entire codebase for our store [on GitHub](https://github.com/Nosto/shopify-hydrogen-demo).

### GitHub Repository
