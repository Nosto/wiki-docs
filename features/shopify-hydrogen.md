description: Using Nosto's React Component Library built specifically for Shopify Hydrogen
---

# Shopify Hydrogen

[Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev) is a powerful React-based framework designed to create custom storefronts on Shopify. We have created a React component library as well as a demo storefront showcasing how our solution can be integrated easily with a Hydrogen-based storefront.

### Shopify Hydrogen React Component Library

To further demonstrate the capabilities of our integration, we've created a React component library specifically tailored to Shopify Hydrogen. Our [component library](https://github.com/Nosto/shopify-hydrogen) utilizes [nosto-react](https://github.com/Nosto/nosto-react) under the hood, while also adding Hydrogen-specific hooks and logic to simplify Nosto integration.

Developers can easily import our library components via NPM into their Hydrogen-based projects to access Nosto's extensive feature set, including recommendations, onsite content personalization, dynamic bundles, pop-ups, and more. Please see below for more details.

### Demo Store

We've also deployed a [live demo store](https://shopify-hydrogen-demo.nosto.com/) via Oxygen to showcase our integration in action. You can also view the entire codebase for our store [on GitHub](https://github.com/Nosto/shopify-hydrogen-demo).

### GitHub Repository

For further information about our Shopify Hydrogen-specific extension of nosto-react, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nosto/shopify-hydrogen). Our repository contains detailed documentation about how to use the library, as well as any updates or patches that may have been made since its initial release.
