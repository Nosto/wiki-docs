# Shopify Hydrogen

[Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev) is Shopify's React-based framework for building custom storefronts. We have created a demo storefront, showcasing how Nosto can be integrated with a Hydrogen-based storefront.

Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nosto/shopify-hydrogen) for our React component library built specifically for Shopify Hydrogen, and our [live demo store](https://shopify-hydrogen-demo.nosto.com/) deployed via Oxygen! This component library works with [nosto-react](https://github.com/Nosto/nosto-react) under the hood and adds Hydrogen specific hooks and logic to make it even easier to implement Nosto on Shopify Hydrogen.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are actively working on achieving 100% compatibility with all Nosto features on Hydrogen. Full compatibility will be achieved in our 1.0.0 release planned for later this year.
