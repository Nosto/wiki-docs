# Supplier Cost & Inventory Level

Nosto supports supplier costs and inventory level. The supplier-cost and inventory-level metadata can be used for creating advanced recommendation rules to promote products with a high margin or low-stock products.

The supplier-cost and inventory-level of a product are considered sensitive information and therefore does not exist in the page tagging, and instead, are sent over a secure API.

### Why don't all my products have the supplier-cost and inventory-level information?

The extension relies on observers to detect changes to the catalog and synchronize it with Nosto. If you are synchronizing products from your ERP/PIM system, observers may not be triggered, and therefore it is necessary that you run a cron to bulk update products to Nosto.

## Enabling / Disabling Inventory-Level Metadata

The inventory-level metadata collection is disabled by default. You can toggle the inventory-level metadata collection by navigating to the configuration page and toggling **Send inventory level to Nosto** under the **Advanced settings** section.

## Enabling / Disabling Inventory-Level Sync After Purchase

In some cases, syncing the inventory level after a purchase might add some loading time to the `thank you` page. As of version `3.7.8`, you can disable it and leave this operation for a later time when running the indexer or updating the product manually.

## Defining the attribute for supplier cost

You can define the attribute to be used for supplier cost from the extension's settings under `Optional attributes`.
