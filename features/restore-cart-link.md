# Restore Cart Link

Nosto supports tagging a restore-cart link. The restore-cart allows you to append a link your all abandoned-cart emails to allow the customer to restore his shopping cart with a single click.

The restore-cart link works across devices but does not authenticate the user for security reasons. The restored session will be handled as a "Guest" user.

## Enabling / Disabling the Restore-Cart Link

The restore-cart link feature cannot be toggled on or off. The feature always attaches a restore cart-link to logged-in customers who have items in their shopping cart.

## Verifying

If you have items in your shopping cart and you are logged in, you should be able to see the new restore-cart link collected by Nosto.
