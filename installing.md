# Installing

There are two ways to install the module: 

- The plugin can also be installed as a "local" plugin by uploading the plugin archive file manually in the Shopware Administration. After this, the plugin can be activated.
- With Composer

**Note:** The plugin has the embedded dependency of [Overdose Job Scheduler](https://bitbucket.org/overdosedigital/shopware-job-scheduler/src/master/). It's delivered with plugin sources.
