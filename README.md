### How the cartridge works

Nosto cartridge provides all necessary data for the tagging implementation as well as helpers for generating the tagging required by Nosto. The placements must be added separately to the templates.

### Verifying the integration

Once you have [installed](Installing) and [configured](Configuring) Nosto you can use Nosto debug toolbar to verify that the tagging is in place. You can activate Nosto debug toolbar by adding parameter `?nostodebug=true` to the end of any URL in store front. Please note that you need to have [Nosto account configured and Nosto must be enabled](configuring/#custom-preferences) in your storefront in order to use the debug toolbar.
