### Getting started

#### How it works

After installation, the Nosto App provides you with Theme App Extensions, which allow you to easily add & move Nosto Placements in your Shopify theme. Placements are used to allow Nosto to understand where a campaign should be positioned. Also included are "App Embedds", which contain the Nosto script (needed to load Nosto on your site) as well as Multi-Currency scrips. You will find more detailed information in this documentation.&#x20;

To collect data about customer behaviour in your store, Nosto will add page tracking across your site. This data will be utilised by Nostos [EXPERIENCE.AI™](https://www.nosto.com/commerce-experience-platform/experience-ai/), and can be used for all products Nosto has to offer.&#x20;

In addition to the information collected from the Front End of your store, the Nosto app also contains a direct connection to your Shopify backend, in order to sync Product & Collection data, receive order information & more. Together, you will be able to drastically enhance the experience your customers have on site, and make every impression relevant.

Nosto also integrates with Shopify Markets, being the first Personalization solution to do so. This allows you to bring your international concept to the next level, by utilising Nosto across all of your Markets. Build unique experiences for every Market, streamline the experience, or go a way anywhere in the middle - it's up to you!
