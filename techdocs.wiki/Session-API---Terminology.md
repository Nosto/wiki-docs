## Terminology

### Action

_Action_ in Session API context means fetching recommendations for a specific view. For example when visitor navigates from front page to a product view you would most likely fetch recommendations related to a [product](https://github.com/Nosto/techdocs/wiki/SPA:-Basics#upon-viewing-a-product). This would be considered as _Action_. Setting the [cart contents](https://github.com/Nosto/techdocs/wiki/SPA:-Basics#setting-the-cart) however would not be considered as action.  

### Route change

_Route change_ in the context of this documentation it means, as it stands, when the navigational route (url) of the application is changed. In traditional web sites this would be a (full) page load.
