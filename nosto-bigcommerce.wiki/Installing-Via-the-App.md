In order to set up Nosto using the public app, you must do so using the following link: https://apps.bigcommerce.com/details/4369

Only store owners can install the app and therefore, you must do so prior to anything else.

Once the app is installed, you must edit your theme to [add the Nosto snippet](Adding-the-snippet).
