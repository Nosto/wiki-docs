In order for our implementation specialists to assist, please grant access to your store to bigcommerce@nosto.com.

**Note:** Do not give access to any single Nosto user. The email address mentioned above is one for the official partner account and is a secure way of granting access.

In order to make changes and tweak your recommendation setup, Nosto will require permissions to edit your theme and also use the script manager to resolve any issues with conversion tracking.

You can grant access by navigating to "Account Settings" and then choosing "Users". Unselect all options and simply grant access to the small list of permissions as itemised below.
